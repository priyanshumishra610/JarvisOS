## 🌟 **Project Vision**

JarvisOS isn’t just another chatbot — it’s a *benchmark* in open-source agentic AI.
A modular, future-ready, multimodal *Autonomous AI OS* that:

* 🧠 *Thinks*: Plans tasks with a ReAct-style loop
* 🗂️ *Chooses Tools*: Selects the right plugins dynamically
* ⚡ *Acts*: Executes tasks autonomously
* 🧾 *Remembers*: Logs every goal, step, and outcome
* 💙 *Understands*: Tracks my mood and adapts

> **I don’t build MVPs. I build benchmarks.**

## 🔥 **Agent Mode: How It Works**

1️⃣ **Goal → Plan → Action Loop**
JarvisOS listens to my *goal* → plans sub-tasks → chooses plugins → executes autonomously → checks results → loops until done.

2️⃣ **Tools as Plugins**
Every plugin is a registered *tool* — searchable & callable by the agent in real time.

3️⃣ **Episodic Memory**
Each task’s context, steps, and results are logged — so JarvisOS *learns* and *improves*.

4️⃣ **Sandboxed & Safe**
Task loops run inside a controlled environment — logging every action with no infinite loops.
