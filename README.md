🤖 JarvisOS

> An open-source, Hugging Face-powered, voice-enabled, emotionally intelligent, plugin-based AI Operating System — built to rival the best.
Designed by Priyanshu to become the most powerful AI assistant on Earth.

🌟 Project Vision

JarvisOS isn't just another assistant. It's a modular, multimodal, future-ready AI operating system that listens, responds, remembers, and evolves — with deep memory, voice understanding, and real-world utility.
We don’t build MVPs. We build benchmarks.
